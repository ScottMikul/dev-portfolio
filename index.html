    <h3> About me</h3>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm Scotty I'm a full stack developer from Atlanta Georgia. I'm a high energy, good attitude kind of guy who
        enjoys comedy. I love coding, learning new things and overcomming challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have quite a bit of coding education and a bit of work experience too. I graduated Georgia Southern with a BS
        in computer science, got a certificate with teamtreehouse in java web development, and more recently graduated from a Full Stack Development bootcamp with Georgia Tech. I had worked as a developer with Home Depot for about 2 and a half years.
    </p>

    <h3>But who am I really?</h3>

    <p>I actually grew up in Marietta Georgia and went to a high school here too. I've been pretty interested in all kinds of sports and while I have a huge passion for video games, I've also been camping quite a bit growing up. I spent some time with the Boy Scouts and that's where I learned the most about camping. I even made it to Eagle Scout. 

    </p>

    <p>
        I play quite a bit of video games. Currently my favorite is card game called Hearthstone, but I play quite a bit of others too. Recently I've grown pretty fond of my fitbit and I've been very focused on tracking calories and maintaining a healthy weight. I'm doing a bit of running. I've signed up for the bubble run and the blacklight run this year. 
    </p>
